# Infrastructure as Code

## Ansible
- Install it on your tools host
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ansible
### TBD
- [x] Create and document standard configuration/playbooks
- [x] Use and document dedicated ssh keys for ansible

## Other systems that failed
- Own program asd -> too much effort
- Saltstack 
  - too heavy to run master and minions
  - official installation does not work out of the box on raspbian
