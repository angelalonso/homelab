# Description

Cluster with 4 Raspberry Pis v1 (32bit)

# Goals

1 Manager Server that doubles as:
- Data store
- Music server
- Frontend to services on the other 3 Servers
- DNS Server
- Ad blocker
- Certificate Authority

3 Node Servers running stuff. Proposed ideas:
- several flavours of 32bit Linux
  - Ubuntu Server
  - Debian
  - Centos?
  - Archlinux?
- Honeypot
- Something in parallel (but what?)
