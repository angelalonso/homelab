# Welcome to my Home Lab

This is a repository meant to keep track of all the bits needed to make it work.

## Goal

Learn how a cluster would work with the law of minimum investment.  
  
So far ~120â‚¬ :/

## Rough instructions

- Buy all the parts, or get them for free.
- Connect the pieces together.
- Burn the images, modify them accordingly to run a configuration script at boot time.
- plug them in the machines, and feed the machines with power!
